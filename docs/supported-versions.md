# Supported versions
While we try to support as many laravel / php versions as possible that is not always possible. 
Below you can find a table with the supported versions per laravel-translation-checker version.

## Versions table 
| **Laravel-translation-checker version** |   **Laravel version**    | **php version** |
|:---------------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:---------------:|
|                   v1                    |    9.* & 10.* * 11.*     |    8.1 & 8.2    |                                                                                     |
|                  v0.*                   | 8.* & 9.* & 10.* & 11.*  | 8.0 & 8.1 & 8.2 |                                                                                 |

## Notes
Below are some caveats with certain versions. Please note them if you are using these versions together.

#### Laravel 11 & php 8.1
Laravel 11 does not support php 8.1, so we have not tested these versions together.


#### Laravel 10 & php 8.0
Laravel 10 does not support php 8.0, so we have not tested these versions together.
